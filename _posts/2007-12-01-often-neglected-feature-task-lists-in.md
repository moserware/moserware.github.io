Often in code, I would put comments like this:

{% highlight c# %}
// TODO: This needs a better name
{% endhighlight %}

which is quite normal. But I almost never took advantage of them fully by having the Task List feature turned on:

![](/assets/often-neglected-feature-task-lists-in/ViewTaskList.png)

Which puts a nice window at the bottom:

![](/assets/often-neglected-feature-task-lists-in/TaskListExample.png)

That will allow you a simple double click access to any comment that starts with "TODO", "HACK" or "UNDONE"

In an effort to get better at tapping the power of Visual Studio, I've added [Sara Ford](http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/) as a top feed in my [reader](http://reader.google.com/).
