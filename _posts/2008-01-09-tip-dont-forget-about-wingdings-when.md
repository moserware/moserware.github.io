At some time in your career, you'll probably need to create an icon for your application, a button, or perhaps a menu item. One place that is often overlooked is all of the *Dings fonts such as Wingdings, Wingdings 2, Wingdings 3, and Webdings. Consider them to be a lot of vector graphics that you don't have to pay extra for. Any graphics program that supports text (like my favorite, [paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/)) will already support them.

While they might not stand on their own to fit your particular need, they're really good for composition with other primitive images.
