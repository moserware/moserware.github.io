I've heard many people (myself included) joke that the best solution to a problem is to do a "FORMAT C:"

Growing up in the around computers, it was one of the most feared commands I could think of typing.

Armed with the benefit of a Windows XP Virtual PC image, I thought I'd actually confront my childhood fear:

What a let down! It won't even let you do it. I even tried a forced quick format.

Alas, another myth broken. I guess there's always "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rm_(Unix)">rm</a> -rf /"

**UPDATE:** Check out [Jonathan's post](http://hohle.net/scrap_post.php?post=23) where he was much more persistent in his attempt.
