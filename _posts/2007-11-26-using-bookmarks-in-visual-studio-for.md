Here's a quick tip to boost your source code browsing speed:

If you need to constantly go back and forth between a few spots in code, place (toggle) a bookmark by pressing CTRL+B+T , then you can always go to the next bookmark by pressing CTRL+B+N or to the previous bookmark by pressing CTRL+B+P

**UPDATE:** As simontew points out in the comments, the exact key mapping depends on your mappings. See [this article](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xc3ed5eh.aspx) for more details.
