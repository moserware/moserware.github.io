This post is coming to you live from [IndyNDA](http://www.indynda.org/)'s Visual Studio 2008 InstallFest.

I have been coming to IndyNDA for about 18 months and this is by far the largest turnout (outside of [Indy Tech Fest](http://indytechfest.org/)). It's amazing what giving away tons of stuff for free will do to the crowd size. I had a good time listening to what other people have been doing with Visual Studio 2008 and the 3.5 framework that came out last month. In addition, I hope the turnout to this event will continue to encourage Microsoft that Indy is capable of hosting a [TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/default.mspx) or maybe a [PDC](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/events/bb288534.aspx) once our updated [convention center](http://www.iccrd.com/) is up running at its new capacity.

Some highlights:

-   Personal message from [Soma](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/) to Indy. 
-   Demos from others like [Aaron](http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/) and [Paul](http://phacker.wordpress.com/). Basically, an open mic night code style. Hopefully indicative of what an [Indy Code Camp](http://www.indycodecamp.com/) might bring. 
-   Giving a demo of my own on the [HashSet class](http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2006/11/09/introducing-hashset-t-kim-hamilton.aspx), sharing with others my love of the [brace matching feature](http://www.moserware.com/2007/12/thought-snippets-for-week-ending-128.html) I found out earlier this month as well as [using bookmarks](http://www.moserware.com/2007/11/using-bookmarks-in-visual-studio-for.html). Finally, I gave a quick peek of the System.AddIn Calculator example that was published in a [two](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/02/CLRInsideOut/) [part](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/03/CLRInsideOut/) series on [MSDN magazine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/).

I was shocked and humbled to win the demo award with around 36 votes. I won a Zune! Thanks [Dave](http://www.davebost.com/blog/)! In addition, I also won a raffle prize of a brand new Microsoft Press Best Practices [book on defect prevention](http://www.microsoft.com/MSPress/books/9198.aspx).

P.S. Afterwards, I watched Dan and Aaron play Guitar Hero on the XBox 360 for a little bit:

I don't think I have the hand-eye coordination for that one.
