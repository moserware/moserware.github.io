-   "Software should have shock absorbers and circuit breakers" - [Michael Nygard](http://podcasts.pragprog.com/2007-10/michael-nygard-interview.mp3). I think far too often we think about having exception handlers and think we're done. I really like Michael's analogy. It makes the case for a more comprehensive, watching out for the user, software design. 
-   By far, the biggest tip I started to employ this week was using "Ctrl + ]" to do brace matching in Visual Studio. For over 5 years I have been using this feature in VIM by pressing the % key. It was a joy to learn that Visual Studio does it as well.
